If there is one trend found in developers conferences this spring, it's convergence. In the technology context, convergence is the idea of no matter the device, your user experience is the same.  

<h2>June 2nd - 6  WWDC</h2>
At Apple's WWDC, they announced the convergence of experiences with their productivity suite (pages, keynote, and numbers) as well as file management in iCloud across all devices (Mac, iPad and iPhone, as well as on any other device through it's browser).  This means that you can work with any of their productivity applications on any device and have the same experience.  New tutorials for their products won't need the "for iPad" or "for Mac" qualification.  It will just be "up and running with Pages" or "getting more out of Numbers".  They also announced that they are working on convergence of photo and video manipulation. 

<h2> June 24th - 25th Google IO </h2>
Google had a similar message of convergence at Google IO.  They are making changes to many of their products like Drive and gmail to create a consistent experience on every device.  They are even working on bringing some Android apps to the Chrome browser!  

Add to that the announcement of Classroom, and teachers now will see a convergence of an LMS (Learning Management System) with Google Drive where the experience is nearly identical on any device.  

<h2>What does this mean for learning? </h2>
Now that the interface, how you interact with the technology, has achieved uniformity and simplicity, the user is able to just get to doing. They don't need training on how to be a user, they simply use the technology to communicate, creatively, critically, collaboratively.
