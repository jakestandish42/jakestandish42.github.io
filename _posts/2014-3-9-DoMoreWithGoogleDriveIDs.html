title: Do More With Google Drive File URLS

<h1>{{ post.title }}</h1>
<p>
Ever notice that the URL to a shared file in Google Drive really long?  Often, when I need to share that url with a large group of people at a training or conference, I need to shorten it.  I prefer Bitly.com because I can customize the urls and make QR codes, and get analytics (More on that at a later post). 
</p><p>
There is some very useful information in this url. Prominently is the file's identification key.  This is a series of about 44 letters, numbers, and sometimes symbols that help Google keep all the files saved in Drive by everyone separate and to locate your file when you call it.  Think of it like a combination lock where you have the spin the dial 44 times and there are 58+ characters on the dial (letters are case sensitive, so lower and upper case matters).

<h4>Example URL of am image file saved in Google Drive</h4>
<pre>https://drive.google.com/#folders/<strong>0Bxriiaw-6rI1TU1rN3FmR1EtZHc <br>
fileID=0Bxriiaw-6rI1TU1rN3FmR1EtZHc</strong></pre>
<br>
<h4>Example URL of a document file saved in Google Drive</h4>
<pre>https://docs.google.com/document/d/<strong>1PYB_miC9xfaC-16xY-47kAKnTkzGHGV1mCM_xNxBpTI<br>
docID=1PYB_miC9xfaC-16xY-47kAKnTkzGHGV1mCM_xNxBpTI</strong></pre>

<h4>Example URL of a spreadsheet file saved in Google Drive</h4>
<p><i>Notice how after the ID the #gid=0 tells you it will open the first sheet in the spreadsheet.  #gid=1 would open the 2nd and so on.</i></p>
<pre>https://docs.google.com/spreadsheet/ccc?key=<strong>0Ahriiaw-6rI1dHU3VW1nX2EtcjB6MFpEZlo4Q0pNZ0E#gid=0<br>
spreadsheetID=0Ahriiaw-6rI1dHU3VW1nX2EtcjB6MFpEZlo4Q0pNZ0E</strong></pre>
