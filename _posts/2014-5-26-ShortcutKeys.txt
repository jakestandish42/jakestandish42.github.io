<h1>{{ post.title }}</h1>


<p>On any student’s first day of learning to play any instrument, they learn a simple tune.  Anyone who had practiced an instrument regularly can recite their first tune decades later even if they haven’t played in many years.  The tune is typically twinkle twinkle little star or some variation of a four or five note melody.  My goal today, is to teach you a four note melody of shortcut keys that will be more useful and impressive any first music lesson. </p>

<h3>The notes (Shortcut Keys)</h3>
<p>There are just four Shortcut Keys in this tune.  
<table>
<thead>
<tr><td>Purpose</td><td>PC</td><td>Mac</td></tr></thead> 
<tr><td>Select all</td><td>Ctrl + a</td><td>Cmd + a</td></tr>
<tr><td>Copy</td><td>Ctrl + c</td><td>Cmd + c</td></tr>
<tr><td>Switch Applications &nbsp;&nbsp;</td><td>Alt + tab&nbsp;&nbsp;</td><td>Cmd + tab</td></tr>
<tr><td>Paste</td><td>Ctrl + v</td><td>Cmd + v</td></tr>
</table>

<h3>The tune (Workflow)</h3>     
<p>This part requires a purpose.  I’m going to give a typical example I use frequently.  The task of completing an online form where you have to fill in a paragraph or more of text. This is never a fun prospect to do in the browser.  Connection issues, limited editor functionality, and numerous other issues make in form editing a risky task.  Besides, I like to keep a copy of what I submitted for my own records.  <i>Before using the shortcut keys there are two things you need open on your computer: </i>your browser with the form loaded and a text editor, Word, LibreOffice, Google Docs, whatever you like to use to edit text. </p>
<ol>
<li>Ctrl + a <br>Select the questions in the form.  Well why not the whole page while we’re at it, this way you have record of the entire contents of the page.</li>
<li>Ctrl + c <br>Copy the contents of the selection</li>
<li>Alt + tab<br>Switch to your text editor.  You may need to press this button several times if you have many applications running. </li>
<li>Ctrl + p<br>Paste the contents of the form into your text editor.</li>
</ol>
<p>And that’s it!  If you compare these steps to what it will take you to do the same with a mouse, you will be amazed how much faster you can complete mundane tasks and get on to the important stuff, like completing that form!</p>
