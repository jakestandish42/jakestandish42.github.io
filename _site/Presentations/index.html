		<p>The most important aspect of a Professional Learning Network (PLN) is having the infrastructure and social networking tools to communicate, collaborate, and share resources. In a large school district like Charlotte Mecklenburg Schools, Yammer has been used to create communities of like-minded teachers across the district and engage them in teaching, learning, and creating in a digital world. In this presentation we will have a panel of educators to discuss how educators and administrators have utilized an enterprise social network (Yammer.com) to discuss all aspects of their profession.</p>
