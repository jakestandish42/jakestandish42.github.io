		<h2><a href="/2014/05/26/ShortcutKeys/">4 Shortcut Keys, Like Your first Music Lesson</a></h2>
      	<p> <h1></h1>


<p>On any student’s first day of learning to play any instrument, they learn a simple tune.  Anyone who had practiced an instrument regularly can recite their first tune decades later even if they haven’t played in many years.  The tune is typically twinkle twinkle little star or some variation of a four or five note melody.  My goal today, is to teach you a four note melody of shortcut keys that will be more useful and impressive any first music lesson. </p>

<h3>The notes (Shortcut Keys)</h3>
<p>There are just four Shortcut Keys in this tune.  
<table>
<th><td>Purpose</td><td>PC</td><td>Mac</td> 
<tr><td>Select all</td><td>Ctrl + a</td><td>Cmd + a</td></tr>
<tr><td>Copy</td><td>Ctrl + c</td><td>Cmd + c</td></tr>
<tr><td>Switch Applications</td><td>Alt + tab</td><td>Cmd + tab</td></tr>
<tr><td>Paste</td><td>Ctrl + v</td><td>Cmd + v</td></tr>
</table>

<h3>The tune (Workflow)</h3>     
<p>This part requires a purpose.  I’m going to give a typical example I use frequently.  The task of completing an online form where you have to fill in a paragraph or more of text. This is never a fun prospect to do in the browser.  Connection issues, limited editor functionality, and numerous other issues make in form editing a risky task.  Besides, I like to keep a copy of what I submitted for my own records.  <i>Before using the shortcut keys there are two things you need open on your computer: <i>your browser with the form loaded and a text editor, Word, LibreOffice, Google Docs, whatever you like to use to edit text. </p>
<ol>
<li>Ctrl + a <br>Select the questions in the form.  Well why not the whole page while we’re at it, this way you have record of the entire contents of the page.</li>
<li>Ctrl + c <br>Copy the contents of the selection</li>
<li>Alt + tab<br>Switch to your text editor.  You may need to press this button several times if you have many applications running. </li>
<li>Ctrl + p<br>Paste the contents of the form into your text editor.</li>
<p>And that’s it!  If you compare these steps to what it will take you to do the same with a mouse, you will be amazed how much faster you can complete mundane tasks and get on to the important stuff, like completing that form!</p>

      	<p> <h1></h1>
<blockquote cite="http://www.goodreads.com/quotes/13719-we-are-what-we-pretend-to-be-so-we-must#">We are what we pretend to be, so we must be careful about what we pretend to be.<footer>Kurt Vonnegut</footer></blockquote>
<p>
This advice has been in my head a lot lately.  It is a lesson I'm learning on a personal level as well as professionally.  As an adult, the concept of pretending is often dramatically inhibited and discouraged.  We are told to keep ourselves in the boxes others, or a past version of ourselves, put us in.  “Stay in your lane” is an expression I hear get used a lot in education. <small>It is a frustrating bit of social conditioning.</small>  
</p>
<p>
For the past year, I have "pretended" to be a web designer and developer.   As a teacher, I've developed a website before, but nothing of the scale or functionality that I was, and am, faced with. I have taken on responsibilities involving responsive and dynamic web design for learning and teaching and faced challenges that were solved purely by determination to find the answer.  Often I would state with confidence I could do a job, simply because I knew it was possible... rarely because I've ever done it.  I've scripted in JavaScript, Python, and Ruby, used PowerShell to configure Chromebooks into our GAFE Admin Dashboard, and I'm working on making a database for this years conference. 
<div class="well"><h4>If I had listened to anyone telling me:</h4> <ul><li>You shouldn't do that</li><li>You don't know how to</li><li>You're a teacher, that's too technical for you</li></ul><h4>I would have agreed with the social conditioning that I'm not supposed to learn something new.</h4>  Fortunately, I don't like to be told what I am<a href="#f1"><sup>[1]</sup></a>.</p>
</div>
<p>
We all must choose how we live, learn, and act.  When we choose a particular path, we are pretending to be as far along that path as our imagination and other people will allow.  In school, we want kids to pretend they are good students and imagine they are graduates with confidence and skills to continue on their imagined path.  We want them to believe they are so that they will have the drive to work at it and be great.     
</p>
<div class="well">
<h4>The Silver Lining to Vonnegut's quote is that <strong>mindful pretending toward a goal is a great recipe for learning.</strong><a href="#f2"><sup>[2]</sup></a></h4>
<li><strong>When you pretend to be something you want to be, you need a good cover story.</strong><p>  A good cover story will have all the details necessary to have someone who's a "real" [learner] not be suspicious of you.  A good cover story, is your research.  It's how you determine exactly what you need to know.  You skim it, read it, analize it until you are confident enough to "pretend".  If you don't have enough confidence to play your part, you can't pretend and everyone will insist you are in the wrong place and shouldn't be bothering all these [learners] with their important work. </li>
<li><strong>When you pretend to be what you want to be, you will enjoy it.</strong><p>  It's really about leveraging Vonnegut's advice to accomplish what you want.  You want to be a [learner], you pretend long enough, doing exactly what it takes to be a [learner], you will be.  You will be willing to be thorough and reflective because you are learning about how to be the [learner] you want to be. </p>

</li>

<p>The more positive approach to this is the phrase <q>Fake it till you make it!</q>.  Or my favorite, <q>If at first you don't succeed, keep on sucking until you do succeed!</q><cite>-Daffy Duck</cite> </p>

		<h2><a href="/2014/03/09/DoMoreWithGoogleDriveIDs/">Do More With Google Drive File URLS</a></h2>
      	<p> <h1></h1>
<p>
Ever notice that the URL to a shared file in Google Drive really long?  Often, when I need to share that url with a large group of people at a training or conference, I need to shorten it.  I prefer Bitly.com because I can customize the urls and make QR codes, and get analytics (More on that at a later post). 
</p><p>
There is some very useful information in this url. Prominently is the file's identification key.  This is a series of about 44 letters, numbers, and sometimes symbols that help Google keep all the files saved in Drive by everyone separate and to locate your file when you call it.  Think of it like a combination lock where you have the spin the dial 44 times and there are 58+ characters on the dial (letters are case sensitive, so lower and upper case matters).  
</p>
<h4>Example URL of am image file saved in Google Drive</h4>
<pre>https://drive.google.com/#folders/<strong>0Bxriiaw-6rI1TU1rN3FmR1EtZHc <br>
fileID=0Bxriiaw-6rI1TU1rN3FmR1EtZHc</strong></pre>
<br>
<h4>Example URL of a document file saved in Google Drive</h4>
<pre>https://docs.google.com/document/d/<strong>1PYB_miC9xfaC-16xY-47kAKnTkzGHGV1mCM_xNxBpTI<br>
docID=1PYB_miC9xfaC-16xY-47kAKnTkzGHGV1mCM_xNxBpTI</strong></pre>
<br>
<h4>Example URL of a spreadsheet file saved in Google Drive</h4>
<p><i>Notice how after the ID the #gid=0 tells you it will open the first sheet in the spreadsheet.  #gid=1 would open the 2nd and so on.</i></p>
<pre>https://docs.google.com/spreadsheet/ccc?key=<strong>0Ahriiaw-6rI1dHU3VW1nX2EtcjB6MFpEZlo4Q0pNZ0E#gid=0<br>

		<h2><a href="/2014/02/15/LearnedHelplessnessIsAChoiceOnceYouRecognizeIt/">Learned Helplessness Is A Choice Once You Recognize It</a></h2>
      	<p> <h1></h1>
<p>
Anyone faced with a seemingly insurmountable challenge has a choice, face the challenge with an equally naive optimism or simply give up.  
The latter, has been found to be the common condition of most animals in psychological tests.  
This concept of learned helplessness was articulated by Martin Seligman in 1965.  
Seligman is famous for shocking dogs in cages.  
Initially the cages were divided in half so the dog was forced to stay on the side where the plates were that delivered the shocks.
Over time, the middle wall was removed providing a way out for the dog to escape the shocks.  
Seligman discovered is that the dog <i> never got out of harms way.</i> 
The dog had learned that the shocks were unavoidable and, as a result, gave up trying to avoid them.  
</p>

<p>
There is a lesson to be learned here in how we approach learning, educational programs, and social and political activities.  
I don't think there is much need to elaborate on the sort of lessons we can learn from helplessness, just realize that when someone says that "I can't..." or "I'm not good at..." or any variant, it's because they got "shocked" too many times by someone or something that eventually told them to give up.    
</p>
<p>
The better thing to consider from the lessons learned from torturing dogs fifty years ago is that it is possible to realize this behavior exists in all of us and we can choose to think differently. 
We can choose the naive optimism and battle the "I can't" that comes natural.  
It is a challenge.
It is hard.  
It will take practice.  
<strong>It is learning</strong>.

<quote>"The defining characteristic of pessimists is that they tend to believe that bad events will last a long time, will undermine everything they do, and are their own fault. The optimists, who are confronted with the same hard knocks of this world, think about misfortune in the opposite way. They tend to believe that defeat is just a temporary setback or a challenge, that its causes are just confined to this one case." - Martin Seligman, Learned Optimism, 1991.</quote>
