Anyone faced with a seemingly insurmountable challenge has a choice, face the challenge with an equally nieve optimism or simply give up.  
The latter, has been found to be the common condition of most animals in psychological tests.  
This concept of learned helplessness was articulated by Martin Seligman in 1965.  
Seligman is famous for shocking dogs in cages.  
Initially the cages were divided in half so the dog was forced to stay on the side where the plates were that delivered the shocks.
Over time, the middle wall was removed providing a way out for the dog to escape the shocks.  
Seligman discovered is that the dog <i> never got out of harms way.</i> 
The dog had learned that the shocks were unavoidable and, as a result, gave up trying to avoid them.
