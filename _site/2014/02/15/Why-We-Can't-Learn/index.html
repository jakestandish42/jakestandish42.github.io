Anyone faced with a seemingly insurmountable challenge has a choice, face the challenge with an equally nieve optimism or simply give up.  
The latter, has been found to be the common condition of most animals in psychological tests.  
This concept of learned helplessness was articulated by Martin Seligman in 1965.  
Seligman is famous for shocking dogs in cages.  
Initially the cages were divided in half so the dog was forced to stay on the side where the plates were that delivered the shocks.
Over time, the middle wall was removed providing a way out for the dog to escape the shocks.  
Seligman discovered is that the dog <i> never got out of harms way.</i> 
The dog had learned that the shocks were unavoidable and, as a result, gave up trying to avoid them.  
</p>
<p>
There is a lesson to be learned here in how we approach learning, educational programs, and social and political activities.  
I don't think there is much need to elaborate on the sort of lessons we can learn from helplessness, just realize that when someone says that "I can't..." or "I'm not good at..." or any variant, it's because they got "shocked" too many times by someone or something that eventually told them to give up.    
</p>
<p>
The better thing to consider from the lessons learned from torturing dogs fifty years ago is that it is possible to realize this behavior exists in all of us and we can choose to think differently. 
We can choose the nieve optimism and battle the "I can't" that comes natural.  
It is a challenge.
It is hard.  
It will take practice.  
<strong>It is learning</strong>.

<quote>"The defining characteristic of pessimists is that they tend to believe that bad events will last a long time, will undermine everything they do, and are their own fault. The optimists, who are confronted with the same hard knocks of this world, think about misfortune in the opposite way. They tend to believe that defeat is just a temporary setback or a challenge, that its causes are just confined to this one case." - Martin Seligman, Learned Optimism, 1991.</quote>
